                <p><b>Maria Takeuchi</b> is regarded as an influential figure in the city pop genre and one of the best-selling
                    artists in Japan. Her songs were commonly used in weddings in Japan. Maria wasn’t really known in the West until 2018 when youtube’s algorithm had her song
                    Plastic Love in everyone’s suggested list. Her most popular songs include   <a href="https://youtu.be/bVNZPAid9iE?t=91" target="_blank">"Honkide Only You"</a>,
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/3wkxIBBP7Vg" target="_blank">"September"</a>
                    and of course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Gj47G2e1Jc" target="_blank">“Plastic Love”</a>.

                    <b>Tatsuro Yamashita</b>, Known as the King of City Pop. With 17 albums under his sleeve and some more on the way, he is the go-to
                    when it comes to City Pop. Inspired by the The Beach Boys, his music is often said to be reminiscent of surfing music in the 70s/80s, especially his album <i>"Big Wave" </i> that was a soundtrack to a surfing movie of the same name. His most popular songs include <a href="https://youtu.be/FaRLAq-x1ow" target="_blank">"Love Space"</a>,  <a href="https://youtu.be/Ah0UMkSbOa4?t=526" target="_blank">"Solid Slider"</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/g7REbdgOZf0" target="_blank">"Ride on time"</a>.

                <b>ANRI</b> (also known as Eiko Kawashima) and many other City Pop artists are being discovered by a new
                    generation of listeners through Future Funk and Vaporwave. Like other artists in this genre, her
                    fame
                    didn’t go past the borders of Japan for years, until the 2018 revival period. Songs from her album <i>"Timley!"</i> are often sampled in songs of the vapourwave and future-funk genre. Her most famous songs
                    include <a href="https://youtu.be/yHKb38-nl3U" target="_blank">"Remember Summer Days"</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/6bALJxjL8jw" target="_blank">"I Can’t Stop the Loneliness"</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/BlvOAd10kJo" target="_blank">"Last Summer Whisper"</a>.
