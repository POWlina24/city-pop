            <h3>City Pop: <br> Urban pop music for those with urban lifestyles</h3>
            <p>
                City Pop is a form of Japanese pop music that emerged in the late 1970s and peaked in the 1980s, heavily
                inspired by the western music of the time. It includes a wide range of styles – including AOR, soft
                rock, R&B, funk, and boogie – with Hawaiian and Okinawan tropical flourishes. It is associated with
                Japan’s leisure class and the country’s economic boom. It had largely been neglected by Westerners and
                seen by many Japanese as cheesy, until it's' revival in 2018.

                City Pop was influenced by the tech that came out during that time like the walkman or cars with
                built-in cassette decks and FM stereos and various electronic musical instruments such as the Casio
                CZ-101 and Yamaha CS-80 synthesizers. In some tracks, you can even hear the tech in them like a cassette
                being inserted to play at a start of a song to a full fake radio narration in a compilation album like
                in Tatsuro Yamashita’s Come along 1 and 2.
